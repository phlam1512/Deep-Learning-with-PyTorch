# Deep Learning with PyTorch
Deep learning implemented in Python and using the `PyTorch` library.

## Aim
The aim is to demonstrate the mastery of some of the deep learning topics, including deep neural networks (DNN), convolutional neural entwork (CNN), variational autoencoders (VAE) and generative adversarial networks (GAN), with a focus on methodology, neural network architecture design,
implementation, training, and evaluation of the performance of a deep learning model.

## Remarks
This group project is submitted as part of assessed coursework for a module at LSE: ST311 Artificial Intelligence.
